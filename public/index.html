//Last updated by RD: 23-Oct-2017
//Built using ReactJS Library version 16.0.0
//
//I decided to use ReactJS for this assignment because I wanted to learn 
//it and get some hands on experience with it. A lot of Javascript development
//in the field is switching to React and I felt like I should learn it for
//a better start out in the job world. Along with becoming a new industry standard
//React is a very powerful library that make it easy to make some very powerful sites.
//React is also very friendly with other libraries and frameworks, It is all around useful.
//
//
//All code for this site is written in Javascript located in the src and components folder,
//this page is just a frame for those Javascript files.

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
